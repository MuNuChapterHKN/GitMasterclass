### FAQ012
What is the difference between "fetch" and "pull" in Git?
In Git, "fetch" and "pull" are two related but distinct commands:

1. **Fetch:**
   - The `git fetch` command is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branches.
   - It downloads new branches and updates existing ones from the remote repository but does not automatically merge the changes into your working directory.
   - Fetching allows you to see what changes are available in the remote repository and decide when to integrate them into your local branches.

2. **Pull:**
   - The `git pull` command is a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`. It fetches changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them into the current local branch.
   - Pull is a convenient way to update your local branch with the changes from the remote repository in a single command. However, it may automatically create a merge commit, which can affect the commit history.

In summary, while both "fetch" and "pull" involve retrieving changes from a remote repository, "fetch" is more explicit and allows you to inspect the changes before merging, whereas "pull" automatically merges the changes into your local branch.
